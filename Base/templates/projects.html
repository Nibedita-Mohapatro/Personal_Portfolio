            During my internship at HAL, I contributed to the development of
            the SMARTMOVE project, which addressed the lack of a digital
            system for employee transportation. The project enables employees
            to submit their travel details online, allowing the transport
            department admin to efficiently assign the most suitable driver
            and vehicle. This streamlined process enhances transportation
            management and improves overall operational efficiency.<br />
            The system includes three user profiles: Employee, Driver, and
            Admin. Employees can submit transportation requests through the
            platform. The Admin reviews these requests, assigns the
            best-suited driver and vehicle, and approves the assignments.
            Drivers have access to functionalities such as GPS integration and
            real-time updates to facilitate smooth transportation
            operations.<br />The project was divided into three parts. I was
            primarily responsible for database management and concurrently
            learned React to assist with frontend development alongside my
            teammate. I also contributed to frontend tasks, gaining valuable
            experience in full-stack development.
